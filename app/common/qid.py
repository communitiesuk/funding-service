# fixme: Ideally we'd implement a protocol like this and derive `SafeQidMixin` from it, which would ensure that
#        any class that uses the mixin has a `question_id` property. But Python's type hinting system doesn't yet
#        support the union of eg a protocol and a Pydantic BaseModel, so we can't do this. 28/6/25
